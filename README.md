# Accessibility Eye Tracker

This was a project done in the 44h year of CASE in DCU with [Luke Edgeworth](https://github.com/Ledge123). This was a project done in 3rd year of CASE in DCU with [Luke Edgeworth](https://github.com/Ledge123). For our final year project, we have sought to create an application that can be used
as an alternative to the standard I/O PC setup of a hardware mouse and keyboard.
This eyetracker application seeks to use a standard desktop webcam to accurately
read where upon the screen the user is looking and to project their gaze onto the
screen, moving the cursor to where the user is looking. Weâ€™ve developed ways
for the user to send inputs to the PC via facial gestures and an on-screen keyboard
with which they can interact with using their gaze. This application was developed
using Python 3.6. A
primary goal for this project was economic accessibility for users, ensuring that it
can be used with relatively low-cost PC components. for more information, you can read the User Manual in the docs Folder.
